"""
I don't really want a foreground interface--- I want a foreground construction yard.  the query is not the right
route for this maybe?

I want to do the things in the editor: create and curate flows, terminate flows in processes, recurse on processes.

anything else?
child fragment flow generators and handlers. scenario tools.

scenarios currently live in the fragments- those need to be tracked somewhere. notably: on traversal, when parameters
are encountered.

Should that be here? how about monte carlo? where does that get done?

when do I go to bed?
